MAC address

AKA media access control address (MAC) is a unique physical address assigned to each network device, and no two device will have the same MAC address.

This is a 6-byte code, 3 from IEEE and 3 from manufacturer. Each ethernet-connected device automatically gets a MAC address from the IP address specified by the user.
